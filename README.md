CODSOFT - Python Internship Projects
This repository contains all the tasks and mini-projects completed during my CodSoft Python Development Internship. These projects focus on building a strong foundation in core Python concepts through simple, real-world applications.

🐍 Projects Included:

🧮 Basic Calculator
A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project emphasizes user input handling, conditional statements, and clean output formatting.

🔐 Password Generator
An application that creates strong and random passwords based on user-defined length and complexity. This project explores the use of Python's random and string modules to enhance security awareness through practical implementation.

✊ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A fun and interactive game where users play against the computer. Featuring randomized computer choices, game logic, and optional score tracking across rounds, this project showcases the application of loops, conditionals, and user interaction.

A journey of learning Python by doing — one project at a time. 🚀 Let the coding continue! 💻🔥
