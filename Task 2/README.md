# 🔐 Password Generator

A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project is built using Python and allows users to specify the length of the password, generating a secure password using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

## 💡 Features

- User-defined password length
- Random password generation using letters, digits, and symbols
- Input validation to handle incorrect entries
- Simple and interactive command-line interface

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the desired length of the password.
2. The program uses Python’s `random.choices()` function to select random characters from a predefined character set.
3. The password is shuffled for extra randomness and displayed to the user.

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter the length of the password: 10
Your required password is: qY@c&K0uT#
```

## 📜 Code

```python
import random
chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*"

try:
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))
    password = []
    password += random.choices(chars, k=length)
    random.shuffle(password)
    password = ''.join(password)    
    print(f"Your required password is: {password}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
```
